# example-cha-extract

Here's a simple GitHub repository showcasing a quick way to get into RQA with .cha files. It's very, very simple, but a start. Breakdown:

1. Using Python, I extract the words and generate an ID for these words and build a .txt file that R can use.
2. In R I import that .txt file and build a CRP.

That's it! 

If you don't have iPython Notebooks, they are fantastic, and you can simply install them straight from a convenient process:

http://ipython.org/notebook.html
http://ipython.org/install.html

To get into all this, I'd:

  1. Install iPython as mentioned above.
  2. Open the .ipynb file in notebook and look around; I also include it in HTML format so you can see.
  3. Open the Rmd file in RStudio and look at the R code (I also include a PDF).

Hopefully this gets you going a bit.
